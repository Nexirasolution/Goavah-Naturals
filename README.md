## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Components)
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Cloudinary (image hosting)
- JWT (jsonwebtoken) for admin auth
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts (dashboard chart)

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Set up environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) → Create a free cluster → Connect → Drivers → copy the connection string |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console) after creating a free account |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Any long random string, e.g. generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Choose your own admin login credentials |

## 3. (Optional) Seed starter data

This adds Goavah Naturals' product categories (Herbal Food & Wellness,
Donkey Milk Skin & Hair Care, Spiritual Products) plus starter products —
weight loss powder, pomegranate red wine, fruits lehyam, donkey milk face
cream, herbal hair oil, rudraksha mala, karungali bracelet, and more — so
the store isn't empty on first run:

```bash
npm run seed
```

> **Note:** the seeded prices, units, and stock counts are placeholders.
> Update them from **Admin → Products → Edit** before going live.

You can then add product photos from **Admin → Products → Edit**.

## 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Storefront: http://localhost:3000
- Admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin/login

## 5. Deploy (Vercel — recommended, free tier works)

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → New Project → import the repo.
3. Add all the environment variables from `.env.local` in the Vercel
   project settings (Settings → Environment Variables).
4. Deploy. Your site will be live at `your-project.vercel.app`.

Make sure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from anywhere
(Network Access → Add IP → `0.0.0.0/0`) since Vercel's IPs are dynamic.
